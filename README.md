## 🤔 How to Use the SteamGifts Automated Extension
1. Open https://www.steamgifts.com and ensure you're logged into your Steam account.
2. Next to each giveaway, you'll see a new "**Add to List**" button. Use it to add games to your library of giveaways you'd like to auto-join.
3. Click the SteamGifts Automated Chrome extension icon to open the pop-up menu (here is where you can manage your games library)
4. Click the "**Enter Giveaways**" button. You will automatically be entered to all available giveaways from your list, provided they fit within your points budget.

## 💻 Installation

2. Extract the zipped contents to your preferred folder.
3. Open a Chromium-based browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Brave) and navigate to the **Manage Extensions** page.
4. Enable **Developer mode** (usually it's a toggle on in the top-right corner of the page).
